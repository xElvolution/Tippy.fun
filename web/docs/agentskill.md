Agent Skills
Give any AI agent self-custodial wallet capabilities with WDK agent skills

WDK provides agent skills: structured instruction sets that teach AI agents how to create wallets, send transactions, swap tokens, bridge assets, and interact with DeFi protocols across 20+ blockchains. All operations are self-custodial. Keys stay on your machine, with no third-party custody dependency.

Skill vs MCP Toolkit: Use an agent skill when your agent platform works with file-based instructions (e.g., OpenClaw, Cursor). Use the MCP Toolkit when your agent supports the Model Context Protocol natively (e.g., Claude, Cursor). Use both for maximum coverage.

What Are Agent Skills?
An agent skill is a structured set of instructions and reference documentation that teaches an AI agent to use a specific tool or SDK. Skills follow the AgentSkills specification. Each skill is a SKILL.md file with frontmatter metadata and detailed instructions that any compatible agent can load and execute.

WDK publishes a skill that covers the full SDK surface: wallet modules, swap, bridge, lending, fiat on/off-ramps, and the indexer. When an agent loads the skill, it learns WDK's APIs so you don't need blockchain expertise to get started. You can view the full skill file on GitHub.

Capabilities
Once an agent loads the WDK skill, it can:

Category
Operations
Wallets

Create and recover wallets across EVM chains, Bitcoin, Solana, Spark, TON, and Tron

Transactions

Send native tokens and token transfers (ERC-20, SPL, Jetton, TRC-20)

Swaps

DEX swaps via Velora (EVM) and StonFi (TON)

Bridges

Cross-chain bridges with USDT0 via LayerZero

Lending

Supply, borrow, repay, and withdraw via Aave V3

Fiat

Buy and sell crypto via MoonPay on/off-ramps

Gasless

Fee-free transfers on TON (via paymaster) and Tron (via gas-free service), and ERC-4337 account abstraction on EVM

All write operations require explicit human confirmation. The skill instructs agents to estimate fees before sending and includes prompt injection protection guidance.

How It Works
Install the skill by running npx skills add tetherto/wdk-agent-skills and selecting the agent you prefer

Agent loads the skill and reads SKILL.md along with per-module reference files to learn WDK's API surface

Agent executes operations when you ask it to create a wallet or send a transaction, generating the correct WDK code

You confirm before any write operation (transactions, swaps, bridges) goes through

The skill includes security guidance: pre-transaction validation checklists, prompt injection detection rules, and mandatory key cleanup patterns.

Self-Custodial vs Hosted
WDK's agent skills use a self-custodial model where your agent controls its own keys locally. This differs from hosted solutions where a third party manages your keys.
